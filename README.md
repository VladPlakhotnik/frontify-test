## Additional information about the project

-   The colored blocks were made via div because I didn't find an element similar to it in the documentation and in the block from frontify
-   The color controller was also not found
-   I didn't understand how to use settings like WCAG and Targets
-   I didn't deploy it because there were problems with my account, I wrote to support, but they couldn't solve it for a whole day
